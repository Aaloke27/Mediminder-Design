# Mediminder App – Figma UI/UX Design

Welcome to the **Mediminder App Design Repository**! This project showcases the complete UI/UX design of Mediminder, created in Figma with a focus on clean structure, consistent styling, and a professional design system.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The Mediminder app is designed to provide a smooth and intuitive user experience for managing medicine reminders. The design focuses on clarity, accessibility, and a modern aesthetic using custom-built components and thoughtful layout decisions.

## 🎨 Key Design Features

### **1. Auto Layout Everywhere**

All frames, screens, buttons, cards, and containers are structured using **Figma Auto Layout**, ensuring:

* Perfect alignment and spacing
* Responsive resizing
* Clean, organized layers
* Easy future modifications

### **2. Custom Components & Variants**

I have created my own **reusable UI components**, including:

* Buttons
* Text fields
* Cards
* Navigation elements

Each component includes **multiple variants**, such as:

* States (default, hover, pressed, disabled)
* Sizes (small, medium, large)
* Styles (filled, outline, tonal)

This ensures the design system stays consistent and scalable.

### **3. Material Design 3 Instances**

The design uses **Google Material 3 principles** through:

* Instance overrides
* Custom theming
* Adaptive UI behavior

However, the styling (colors, font combinations, spacing rules) is tweaked to fit the Mediminder brand.

### **4. Classy Color Palette (Custom Local Colors)**

The entire color system is built using **local color styles**, ensuring:

* Consistency across all screens
* Easy theme management
* A modern and classy look

Colors include custom accent, surface, text, and background shades designed by me.

### **5. Typography Styles (Created by Me)**

I have created a complete **local font style system**, including:

* Headline styles (H1–H6)
* Body text styles
* Label styles
* Caption styles

This makes the design balanced, readable, and professional.

### **6. Organized Layer Structure & Style System**

All components, colors, fonts, and grids are named properly and follow a consistent structure so other designers/developers can understand the system easily.
